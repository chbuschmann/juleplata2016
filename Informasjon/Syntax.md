#Overview

The golden rule of Fountain is simple: make it look like a screenplay. But if you'd like a little more guidance than that, here are some very simple syntax rules to remember:

- Scene Headings start with INT, EXT, and the like.
- Character names are in UPPERCASE.
- Dialogue comes right after Character.
- Parentheticals are wrapped in (parentheses).
- Transitions end in TO:
- Those are the basics. If you want to get a little more advanced:

- Anything can be a Scene Heading, just start it with a period.
- To make any line a Transition, start it with a greater-than symbol.
- You may want to emphasize some text:

- Underline by bracketing with _underscrores_.
- Italicize by bracketing with *asterisks*.
- Bold text is surrounded by **double asterisks**.
- You can combine emphasis. For example, ***bold italics,*** or _an *italicized* word within an underlined phrase_.

If you'd like to keep a handy reference of these rules, there's a printable PDF on the How To page. You'll also find ideas there about how to transform Fountain text into something you can print, share, or edit in traditional screenwriting software.
